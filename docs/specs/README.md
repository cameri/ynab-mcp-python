# Spec-Driven Development

This project follows a spec-driven development approach. This means that we will be writing specifications for our
software before we write any code. This helps us to ensure that we are building the right thing, and that we are
building it in the right way.

We will be using the following specifications:

- **requirements.md**: This file will contain the requirements for the software, written in the EARS (Easy Approach to
  Requirements Syntax) format.
- **design.md**: This file will contain the design for the software, including the architecture, data models, and API
  specifications.
- **tasks.md**: This file will contain a list of tasks that need to be completed in order to implement the software.

We will be using the templates in the `template` directory to create these specifications.

## Current Specifications

- [01-lookup-all-budgets](01-lookup-all-budgets/requirements.md): Specification for looking up all budgets in a YNAB
  account.
